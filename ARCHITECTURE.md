# Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of the Donna Paulson AI Executive Assistant. It provides a comprehensive overview of how the system is organized and how the different components interact.

## System Overview

The system is composed of the following main components:

- **User Interface (UI):** This is the front-end part of the system where users interact with the AI assistant.

- **AI Engine:** This is the core part of the system. It processes user inputs and generates appropriate responses.

- **Data Storage:** This is where user data and system data are stored.

## Component Interaction

The interaction between the components is as follows:

1. The user interacts with the UI and sends a request to the AI Engine.

2. The AI Engine processes the request, generates a response, and sends it back to the UI.

3. The UI displays the response to the user.

4. The AI Engine also interacts with the Data Storage to store and retrieve data as needed.

## Future Improvements

This architecture is designed to be scalable and flexible to accommodate future improvements and features.
